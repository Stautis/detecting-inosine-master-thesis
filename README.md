# detecting-inosine-master-thesis
This repo was created to host the most important pieces of code for producing the results presented in my master thesis. 

The various scripts have been organized into a set of folders to establish a correspondence between the presentation of the results in the thesis itself and the scripts that were used to produce those results. Basecalling and alignment scripts have been placed at the highest level within the experiment folders since these, in most cases, are foundational steps without which no further analysis would take place.

All scripts reflect the structure of the server where data has been hosted and analysis been carried out.
